While investigating a search trace it may happen that the visualisation shows a result contrary to the user’s expectation. Typically in such cases the user will want to investigate the problem further. To this end, the system allows users to simply hover their mouse cursor over the node to see a pop-up box displaying information about that node, as shown in Figure 1(E). Included in the display are labels such as id, parent, type, f, g and h-values, and any associated metadata from the search trace. Clicking the node of interest further shows the path from the start location, which makes it possible to investigate the sequence of decisions leading to algorithm to be in a contrary state.
Alongside the canvas, our system also displays an event log, as illustrated in Figure 1(F). Here we show in textual form information from the search trace. This feature allows the user inspect the log by eye and provides fast additional context about how the algorithm behaves
“just before” and “just after” a point of interest. Events in the log are coloured coded so as to more easily create a correspondence between the current canvas event and the current log entry.
