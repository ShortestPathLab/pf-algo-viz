In addition to manual breakpoints, we consider several tests which might indicate an error on failure. In each case we pause the playback of the search trace and we display an appropriate warning.
The first automatic check is for the consistency of the heuristic function. This is a common property for pathfinding algorithms with optimality guarantees and a violation of the consistency criteria could indicate an error.4 An estimate h(n) is called consistent if for each successor n′ we have h(n) ≤ d(n,n′)+h(n′) where d(n,n′) is the cost to reach n′ from n.
The second automatic check tests whether the g-value of each successor node is monotonically increasing with respect to its parent node. If this test fails it indicates a negative cost cycle might exist in the graph, which is certainly an error.
The third automatic check tests whether the g-value labels of each expanded node match the corresponding g-value labels in a known- good reference trace. The nodes are compared based on their coordinate values on the canvas. In this case the system executes the current trace and displays list of nodes where g value diverged from the second, DH: reference trace.
