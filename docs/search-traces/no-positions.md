Sometimes a pathfinding algorithm might be run on an problem that does not include 2D positions, for example a shortest-path algorithm performed on an abstract network without an embedding (layout) in the plane. This is an issue since the system visualises the search on a 2D canvas and thus requires positions for nodes. The layout property accounts for such cases. It can be specified as tree or network or none, each value being used to indicate the type of approach to use when computing canvas positions for the different events. For all values except none the system includes another step before visualisation, where it processes the entire search trace and builds a network of search nodes with edges based on the relation of different nodes with each other. Appropriate positions for each node are then computed with D3 [4], a popular layout library.
