We control the drawing process using a playback mechanism which displays events one after the other. Via toolbar buttons, the user is able to play, pause, step forward and backward, or reset the visualisation (back to the beginning of the trace), as shown in Figure 1(B). The play function automatically steps through the trace events, one after another. The other playback controls progress the search to a different point, updating the canvas, and leaving the search paused.
Since the search and background might be very large, the canvas also features controls, shown in Figure 1(D), for panning and zooming as well as automatically scaling. This is useful to fit in the viewing region the entirety of the search visualised thus far and/or the entirety of the operating environment.
