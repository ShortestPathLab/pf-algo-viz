We allow users to set breakpoints, which are conditional statements about events. Breakpoints can be set on labels: id, parent, f-value, g-value or h-value. In each case the breakpoint compares the label value against a user-specified value using standard comparison opera- tors. During playback of the trace, if the current event satisfies one of the breakpoint conditions we pause the system which gives the user an opportunity to inspect the state of the algorithm at a point of interest. The system can be subsequently resumed and execution of the trace continues until the next breakpoint or until the last event is processed.
