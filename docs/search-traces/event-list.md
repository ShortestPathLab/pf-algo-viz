The eventList is an array of objects each of which describes the state of a node at a specific point during search. Each node can be in one of several states: generating, updating or expanding. There are other implicit states as well like source and destination (equiv. target). Each event in the list is a record that reflects the internal state of the algorithm at a particular point during execution. That means nodes may occur in the list multiple times as their state changes.
Each event in the list specifies a minimum amount of information about its associated node: the node identifier (id), its parent label (pId), the event type (generating, updating or expanding), and its associated cost or g-value, (g). Optional data includes the node’s estimated cost or h-value (h) and a bound on the total cost, from start to target via the current node (f). The “see” what an event looks like in context we allow the user to instantiate various drawing primitives using a variables object. When node can be represented with a simple primitive, such as a cell or circle, the variables object may require only x and y coordinates as data. When the node interpretation is more complicated the drawing instructions can contain additional drawing information. Finally, the event can specify a metadata object containing any extra information that the practitioner wants to associate with that particular node and expose through the interface.
