# Debugger

The purpose of the app is not just limited to visualising the path finding search algorithm but also debug them at the same time. As this app only requires a trace file, it can't necessarily be of complete and correct search. This could be used by the students who are trying to learn and implement the algorithms. Researchers can use this to do the same as well as debugging new algorithms. While simple playback functionality with node information on hover features can help a lot to understand how the search is unfolding, we also have more mechanisms to detect other runtime bugs. We have 3 different techniques to debug the search(other than playback and node information):
- Breakpoints
- Automatic Error Detection
- Search Trace Comparison
