Pathfinding problems appear in a wide variety of different domains and they are solved with algorithmic approaches that are just as diverse. A generalised visualistion system needs to account for this diversity and allow for customised representations of each algorithmic technique in context. Some important considerations:
• The search can have multiple start and target nodes. For example in bi-directional search one simultaneously expands from start to target and from target to start.
• Node operations may or may not one represent a single configura- tion of the agent. For example, a node can be a distinct location in the operating environment or it may represent a set of potential states.
• Nodes may or may not have an embedding. For cases where no embedding exists the visualisation needs to automatically com- pute positions for each node operation in the search trace.
To demonstrate the efficacy our approach we consider four distinct application examples: (i) grid-based pathfinding and (ii) road network routing (two classic setups commonly targeted by domain-specific tools); (iii) pathfinding on a navigation mesh (a problem drawn from computer games sometimes requiring bespoke visualisations); (iv) tree search (a problem setting without an embedding).
